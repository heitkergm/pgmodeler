/*	The plug-ins in pgModeler must be within the "plugins" folder in their own
		directory and must have the following basic structure:

		 [PGMODELER_PLUGINS_DIR]/
					|
					+ - pluginA/
							 |
							 + ---- (lib)*(pluginA.)(so|dylib|dll) (library)
							 |
							 + ---- res/
											 |
											 +--- pluginA.qrc (resource file)
														|
														+--- /pluginA (context)
																 |
																 +--- pluginA.png (icon)

		> Library: it's the shared object that represents the plugin. The prefix (lib) and suffix (so|dylib|dll) are plataform dependent.
		> Resource file: it's the file where all icons used by the plug-in are registered.
		> Context: it's is the default namespace where the plug-ins are organized logically inside the .qrc file.
		> Icon: it is a PNG image that represents an icon of the plug-in

		> Plug-ins can have an optional "lang" subdir to store the UI translations for them. The translation files must be named
			in the form [plugin name].[lang code].qm, for instance, Brazilian Portuguese translation for "sampleplugin"
			would be: "sampleplugin.pt_BR.qm".

	Note: Plug-ins can have additional subdirectories but any reference to them must be made programatically by the plug-in author. */
